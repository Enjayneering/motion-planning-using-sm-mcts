occupancy_grid_maze_20.txt | Collision avoidance, faster agent slows down because blue agent blocks
occupancy_grid_maze_31.txt | Tree grows degenerated, since cannot handle infinity payoffs
occupancy_grid_maze_33.txt | Cpompetitive and reasonable, Nash
occupancy_grid_maze_33.txt | Agent 1 gets punished more for collision, thats why it might stop more
door_1_open_18 | Game Theoretic Blocking Behaviour
door_1_open_24 | Very nice Game Theoretic Behaviour!
door_2_open_02 | Red blocks
occupancy_grid_21_open_10 | why is high number of simulations leading to a weird noisy behaviour?
